# Ideas

- dynamically drawn/rendered visuals
- interactive/animated visuals
- bonus game or something fun?
  - guitar hero style?
  - Mare's idea: customize the look of each cartoon version of the band members and then they can play on the stage during the guitar hero style game
    - custom stickers/shirts/etc with the band customized your way?
  - hacking game where end results are unreleased outwith songs/stems/etc
- provide public repo with instructions so other bands/people can use this code
